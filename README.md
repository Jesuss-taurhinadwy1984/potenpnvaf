Just stumbled out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Sikandar, and holy moly, my brain feels like it's been in a blender set to high speed but left open with no lid. You ever sit through a  , and halfway through, your mind starts wandering to that one awkward time you tried cutting your own bangs because you thought it would make you look like a rockstar? Yeah, that's me right now. 

Sikandar, huh. It's one of those 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 that's kind of all over the place. I mean, it's got its serious moments, but then, BAM, it's suddenly going left field with these unexpected twists — like juggling flaming bowling pins at a kid's birt𝘏𝘋ay party. It's intense and kind of ridiculous in the best way possible. There were moments I was on the edge of my seat, clutching my half-spilled popcorn, making me question every life decision. 

I mean, that kid, Sikandar, he's something. The kind of resilient you find in those $2 store combs that refuse to break no matter how tangled your hair gets. He's facing the world, and pal, the world ain't being kind. But there’s this weird tempo to the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮, like a hair dryer in a wind tunnel — noise, pauses, then WHOOSH. Idk, maybe it’s just me feeling all existential after a long day on my feet.

> And can we talk about the cinematography? Some scenes hit you like jumping into cold water, vibrant and sudden, while others are slow, like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 paint dry on a humid, drizzly day. It’s art, they say. Or maybe just an elaborate way to mess with our heads. Do directors get a kick out of 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 us squirm? 

The sound design, oh boy. At one point, I was convinced the speakers were possessed — what a cacophony. Like a symphony of honking, clashing scissors in my salon when everyone’s in a rush before a long weekend. It’s absolute chaos and genius. Really.  

Now, I’m not saying you should run out and 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   on some sketchy site or anything, but... maybe I am? Just avoid the spoilers, man. Part of the ride is not knowing where it's taking you – like trying that risky new hair dye that may or may not turn out to be green instead of mahogany.

And as I'm attempting to untangle my thoughts and this   from my head, let me leave you with this absolute gem that has no relevance whatsoever but just kinda popped into my mind: 

```javascript
function unleashPigeons(sceneNumber) {
  for (let i = 0; i < sceneNumber; i++) {
    console.log(Release pigeons!, i);
  }
}
```

But, anyway, what do I know? I'm just here with hair clippings stuck to my sneakers and a mind full of Sikandar madness. Maybe tomorrow, I'll 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again and try to fit these scattered thoughts into something coherent? Or maybe I’ll just stick to my safe side and stick to cutting hair. Who knows?
